4/6/8HP Eurorack prototyping boards (pad per hole)

Eurorack module prototyping boards - these are more conducive to mounting behind a faceplate than my EPB boards (which, in truth, are more breadboard-like).
They are sized to fit behind 4HP, 6HP or 8HP panels; all have M3 mounting holes at each corner to allow either fixing to a faceplate and/or spacers to allow
boards to be stacked.

Note that these boards are pad-per-hole - there are no electrical connections between any of the pads. Whilst this offers more flexibility than a typical breadboard
style layout, it comes at the cost of having to make your own connections between components - you can do this either using the component leads themselves (just cut
to size and solder) or by using 30AWG or similar hookup wire. The pad holes are at 2.54mm centres, meaning you can use 'regular' DIP sockets for ICs.

Overall approximate board dimensions are:

- 4HP - 99.8mm(H) x 18.0mm(W)
- 6HP - 99.8mm(H) x 28.2mm(W)
- 8HP - 99.8mm(H) x 38.1mm(W)

The zip archives contain the Gerber files necessary for fabrication - send them to your favourite fab and the job is done. 

I am planning to make pre-fabbed boards available for purchase during early 2023.
